------------------------

R workspace containing the following objrcts:

 data: matrix of gene expressions with the 198 untreated patients in rows from the TRANSBIG validation study and the affy probesets in columns (22283). The probesets are all the probsets from the chip hgu133a MAS5 normalization was performed with a target value of 600.
 
 demo: matrix with clinical information concerning the untreated patients (198).
 
 annot: annotations of all the probesets (22283).
